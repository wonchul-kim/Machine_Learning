    "As for object tracking, it seems like the traditional methods stood the test of time better than the object detection ones. Ideas like Kalman filtering, sparse and dense optical flow are still in widespread use. Kalman filtering entered hall of fame when it was used in the Apollo PGNCS to produce an optimal position estimate for the spacecraft, based on past position measurements and new data. Its influence can be still seen today in many algorithms, such as the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT), which uses a combination of the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filter to achieve decent object tracking."

    "#### ROLO\n",
    "For starters, we can check out Recurrent [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05781) (ROLO), a single object tracking method that combines object detection and recurrent neural networks. ROLO is a combination of YOLO and LSTM. The object detection module uses YOLO to collect visual features, along with location inference priors. At each time-step (frame), the LSTM receives an input feature vector of length 4096, and returns the location of the tracked object.\n",

    "#### SiamMask\n",
    "When it comes to single object tracking, [SiamMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05050) is an excellent choice. It is based on the charming siamese neural network, which rose in popularity with [Google’s Facenet](https://blog.netcetera.com/face-recognition-using-one-shot-learning-a7cf2b91e96c). Besides producing rotated bounding boxes at 55 frames per second, it also provides class-agnostic object segmentation masks. In order to achieve this, SiamMask needs to be initialized with a single bounding box so it can track the desired object. However, this also means that multiple object tracking (MOT) is not viable with SiamMask, and ***modifying the model to support that will leave us with a significantly slower object detector.***\n",

    "\n",
    "[TrackR-CNN](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/mots-multi-object-tracking-and-segmentation/MOTS.pdf) was introduced just as a baseline for the [Multi Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) challenge](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/page/mots), but it turns out that it is actually effective. First off, the object detection module utilizes Mask R-CNN on top of a ResNet-101 backbone. The tracker is created by integrating 3D convolutions that are applied to the backbone features, incorporating temporal context of the video. As an alternative, convolutional LSTM is considered as well, but the latter method does not yield any gains compared with the baseline.\n",
    "TrackR-CNN also extends Mask R-CNN by an association head, to be able to associate detections over time. This is a fully connected layer that receives region proposals and outputs an association vector for each proposal. The association head draws inspiration from siamese networks and the embedding vectors used in person re-identification. It is trained using a video sequence adaptation of batch hard triplet loss, which is a more efficient method than the original triplet loss. To produce the final result, the system must decide which detections should be reported. The matching between the previous frame detections and current proposals is done using the Hungarian algorithm, while only allowing pairs of detections with association vectors smaller than some threshold."

The CVPR 2019 Tracking Challenge motivated progress in both accuracy and speed of the trackers. Tracktor++ dominated the leaderboard with a very simple, yet effective approach. This model predicts the position of an object in the next frame by calculating the bounding box regression, without needing to train or optimize on tracking data whatsoever. The object detector for Tracktor++ is the usual Faster R-CNN with 101-layer ResNet and FPN, trained on the MOT17Det pedestrian detection dataset.\n",
