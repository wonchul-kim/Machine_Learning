    "Within feed-forward networks, there is no state maintained by the network at all. The classical examples of a sequence model are the Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging and conditional random field.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent neural network is a network that maintains some kind of state. For example, its output could be used as part of the next input, so that information can propogate along as the network passes over the sequence. In the case of an LSTM, for each element in the sequence, there is a corresponding hidden state $h_t$, which in principle can contain information from arbitrary points earlier in the sequence. We can use the hidden state to predict words in a language model, part-of-speech tags, and a myriad of other things.\n",
